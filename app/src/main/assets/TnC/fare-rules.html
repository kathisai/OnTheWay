        <h1>Fare Rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Failure to show up for the flight at least 45 minutes prior to the scheduled
                departure will result in the fare being forfeited
            </li>
            <li>Changes and cancellations to flights can be done up to 1 hour prior to the scheduled
                departure time for Domestic flights, and up to 3 hours prior to departure for
                International and Interline flights. All promo/sale fares are restrictive fares and
                are non-refundable. Certain promo/sale fares do not permit changes to the flight.
                Please check restrictions on the fare while booking
            </li>
            <li>With effect from 06th September 2013, for all Domestic sectors changes to your
                booking will attract a flight change fee of 1500 INR per passenger per sector per
                change. For International Travel changes and cancellations can be done to flights
                with the payment of a change/cancellation fee of 1850 INR per person, per one way
                and per change. (Please refer Clause [3.1.9] of the T &amp; C for applicable change/
                cancellation fee for international bookings). For Interline travel, changes and
                cancellations can be done at a charge of INR 4600 per passenger per one-way journey
                per change. All promo/sale fares are non-refundable. Changes are permitted at
                regular charges.
            </li>
            <li>In the event of cancellation of non-cancellable ticket(s), the passengers shall only
                be refunded the amount paid towards any kind of taxes/ duties/ levies and/ or fees.
            </li>
            <li>All fees are subject to change without notice.</li>
            <li>Due rescheduling, if the same booked fare is not available at the time of change,
                any difference in fare will also be applied in addition to the change fee plus
                changes to any applicable fees at the time of changes. All fees are subject to
                change without notice.
            </li>
            <li>Incase of cancellations, the balance of the original booking amount will be retained
                in a credit shell where the passenger may use it as payment towards future travel by
                calling our Reservations. At-least one of the passengers booked in the original PNR
                (Credit Shell PNR) should be travelling in the new PNR for future travel. The Credit
                Shell is refundable on request.
            </li>
            <li>Name changes are not permitted.</li>
            <li>Bookings made under Student Discount are non-cancellable.</li>
            <li>Certain fares could carry a restriction related to change/cancellation and policy.
                In case you do not wish to opt for restricted fare, you can book two separate PNRs
                for each sector without the benefits/restrictions of the return fare.
            </li>
